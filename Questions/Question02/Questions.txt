Question:
<html>
<p> A rock climbing enthusiast poses for a picture . However, he needs to make sure that there is enough friction between his legs and the rock so that he does not slip and injure himself. The mass of the person is 100 kg. What should the coefficient of static friction be so that the person does not slip against the rock.</p>

End Question
Assumptions:
For easier calculation, assume that the legs of the person are straight.|correct
This assumption makes the problem easier.|valid
The person won’t be able to stabilize his/her position if the legs are bent.|invalid
End Reasons
All frictional forces can be neglected|incorrect
Person would slip if no friction exists between legs and the rock.|valid
The friction between rope and the pulley (which helps the person to grab the rope) is not negligible.|invalid
Friction between rope and the point of contact of the rock is not negligible.|invalid
End Reasons
The support at point A is a fixed support.|incorrect
The system is free to rotate about that point, but not free to move in x or y, therefore it is a pin support.|valid
The system can move in the x direction and is free to rotate, and is a roller support.|invalid
End Reasons
Support at point A is a hinge support.|correct
The system can rotate about that point, but can’t move in the x or y direction.|valid
The system is free to rotate about that point but has no other constraint.|invalid
End Reasons
The line of action of the tension in the rope coincides with the center of mass.|correct
This naturally happens as the person stabilizes himself or herself.|valid
The center of mass is assumed to be at the hip joint.|invalid 
End Reasons
End Assumptions
FBDHints:
The unknown is the coefficient of static friction. The reaction force between the legs and the rock is of interest.
Mass of the human is assumed to go through the line of action, vertically downwards.
