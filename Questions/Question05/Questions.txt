Question:
<html>
<p> A person tries to lift a medicine ball of 20 pounds on the palm of his hand as shown. What is force on the bicep muscle if the vertical force exerted on the forearm is neglected.</p>
<p> Use the following data :
<ul>
	<li>The length of the hand from the end of the elbow to the end of the palm is L.
	<li>The distance between the end of the elbow to the center of the bicep muscle is d.
	<li>The weight of the hand (from the end of the elbow to the end of the palm) is distributed in a triangular fashion, with more weight towards the elbow.
</ul>

Assumptions:
The elbow joint is a fixed support.|incorrect
The elbow joint can allow rotation.|valid
The weight of the ball is too small to generate a moment.|invalid
End Reasons
The force of the bicep muscle acts at the center, which is symmetrically placed between the elbow and the forearm.|correct
This assumption makes the analysis easier, since the location of the net force acting is much more simplified.|valid
This assumption makes sure that the elbow can be modeled as a pin joint.|invalid
End Reasons
The hand is perfectly horizontal.|correct
This assumption makes the analysis easier.|valid
This assumption is the reason all frictional forces can be neglected.|invalid
End Reasons
The ball is perfectly symmetric and the weight acts through the center of the ball.|correct
This assumption makes the analysis less complicated.|valid
Not making this analysis would make this a dynamic problem.|invalid
End Reasons
End Assumptions
FBDHints:
The tension in the bicep muscle is of interest.
The elbow is a pin joint, the reaction forces at the joint will be needed.
End FBDHints
