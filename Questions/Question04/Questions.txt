Question:
<html>
<p> A family put up a swing in their backyard. They fear that the horizontal member of the system might not be safe for both swings to be occupied at the same time as another child hangs from the rings. Is the structure safe? Make sure static analysis is sufficient for this problem. </p>
<p> Use the following data for the problem :
<ul>
	<li>The weight of all three children is 50 pounds.
	<li>All angles are in degrees and distances in meters. 
	<li>The length of the arm of the child on the swing in 0.5m.
	<li>The axial load carrying capacity of the member is 500 pounds. 
	<li>The maximum bending moment the member can resits is 2000 pound feet.
</ul>

Assumptions:
Children get onto the swing and the rings very gently.|correct
This should happen since the model is solved using static analysis.|valid
Not using this assumption would complicate the statics model.|invalid
End Reasons
For easier calculation, assume that the elbows are completely locked out.|correct
This assumption makes the calculations easier.|valid
That is the only way to stabilize on the swing or rings.|invalid
End Reasons
The support on the left end of the frame can be modeled as a fixed support.|incorrect
The system is free to rotate about that point, but not free to move in x or y, therefore it is a pin support.|valid
The system can move in the y direction and is free to rotate, and is a roller support.|invalid
End Reasons
Support at the right end is a hinge support.|correct
The systems free to rotate about that point but can not move in x or y direction.|valid
The system can not move at that point at all.|invalid
End Reasons
The kids on the swing sit symmetrically with respect to both ends of the swing.|correct
Not using this assumption would complicate the model.|valid
That is the only way the kids could balance on the swing.|invalid
End Reasons
The kid on the rings has a hold on the rings symmetrically.|incorrect
The rings are not at the same height. The kid has to extend each arm at a different angle if the elbows are locked out.|valid
The kid is not stable on the rings, and the system is moving.|invalid
End Reasons
The hip joint is modeled as a fixed joint.|incorrect
The body can rotate about that point.|valid
The body cant resist moment about that point.|valid
End Reasons
End Assumptions
FBDHints:
The member of interest is the horizontal member. 
Make sure to account for forces due to children on swings and the ring.
