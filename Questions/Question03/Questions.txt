Question:
<html>
<p> A person starts to climb up a ladder to clear some snow of the roof. What should the coefficient of static friction between the ground and the ladder be so that the person can go unto half the height of the ladder safely. Neglect the weight of the shovel.</p>
<p> Use the following data :
<ul>
	<li>The total length of the ladder is 8 feet. 
	<li>The weight go the ladder is 20 pounds.
	<li>The weight of the person is 100 pounds.
	<li>The coefficient of static friction between the wall and the ladder is 0.5.
	<li>The angle that the ladder makes with the horizontal is 45 degrees.
</ul>

Assumptions:
The ladder does not have the same properties throughout its length.|complicated
Using this assumption complicates the model. For example, the center of gravity of the ladder needs to be calculated and so on.|valid
Using this assumption would mean the analysis is no longer a static analysis.|invalid
End Reasons
One of the reasons for different coefficient of static friction is the amount of snow at the top and the ground may differ.|correct
The presence of snow will lower the friction between the surface of interest and the ladder, and the case where there is exactly equal snow on both surfaces is a very rare possibility..|valid
The amount of snow is linearly varying with the coefficient of static friction.|invalid
End Reasons
All frictional forces can be neglected.|incorrect
Friction is acting on points where the ladder makes contact with the ground and the roof.|valid
Friction between the roof and the ladder can be neglected since the friction at the ground is already accounted for.|invalid
End Reasons
The point where the ladder rests at the ground can be modeled as a fixed support.|incorrect
The system is free to rotate about that point.|valid
The system can move in the x direction and is free to rotate, and is a roller support, with freedom to move in x direction.|invalid
End Reasons
End Assumptions
FBDHints:
All forces on ladder and frictional forces on point of contact are of interest.
The weight of the ladder is acting at the mid point of the ladder.
