Question:
<html>
<p> A person starts to stack up weights on a barbell for a front squat. However, the person begins to load the bar on one side and then the other. Assume the weights available are 45 lbs(2.4 inch wide) and 25 lbs(1.5 inch wide). What is the maximum amount of weight the person can load before the barbell begins to flip.</p>
<p> Use the following data for the barbell :
<ul>
	<li>The total length of the barbell is 86 inches.
	<li>The distance between the support A and the first weight is 5.6 inches.
	<li>The distance between the supports is 44 inches.
</ul>

Assumptions:
The weights must be placed very gently on the bar.|correct
If the weights are not placed gently, time dependent forces or an impulse may be generated and inertial forces need to be considered. This would no longer be a statics problem.|valid
Placing the weights abruptly will generate frictional forces, complicating the statics model further.|invalid
End Reasons
The assumption that the weight of the empty bar acts in the middle is needed for this analysis.|incorrect
The governing equation is written for the whole bar, ie there is no need to cut the bar in this problem.|valid
Most of the mass is centered at the ends of the barbell.|invalid
End Reasons
All frictional forces can be neglected.|correct
Considering frictional forces will complicate the model further.|valid
There is no friction acting on the system.|invalid
End Reasons
The support at point A can be modeled as a pin support.|correct
The system is free to rotate about that point, but it can not move in x or y direction.|valid
The system is free to rotate about that point, and a reaction moment is generated at that point.|invalid
End Reasons
The support at point B can be modeled as a pin support.|correct
The system is free to rotate about that point. Also, as the weight increases it will move in the y direction. Therefore it is a roller support.|invalid
The support can be modeled as a pin support, but as soon as the bar begins to move, it is no longer a statics problem.|valid
End Reasons
Modeling both supports as a pin would make the system statically indeterminate.|correct
There would be more unknowns than number of equations.|valid
There would be more equations than unknowns.|invalid
End Reasons
Just when the bar begins to move, all the displacements are very small. All changes in the location of center of mass and weight distributions etc cant be neglected.|complicated
Using this assumption would complicate the system.|valid
More reaction forces would be generated at point A.|invalid
End Reasons
The weight of all the plates can be modeled as a single point load acting in the middle of the stacked weights.|incorrect
Since the dimension of the plates are different, the effective total weight would not be acting at the center.|valid
Friction between the plates cant be neglected.|invalid
End Reasons
End Assumptions
FBDHints:
The forces on the barbell is of interest.
The weight of the barbell can be assumed  to be acting on the center, and deflections when the bar is about to flip, are very small and can be ignored.
